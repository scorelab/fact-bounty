    ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ...
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo -H pip install virtualenv
    ```

-   #### Dependencies

    -   Create and fire up your virtual environment in python3:

        ```bash
        virtualenv -p python3 venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

        For *Windows* you can use -

        ```

        ```

-   #### Environment Variables

    -   Change directory to the folder

        ```bash
        $ cd fact-bounty-flask
        ```

    -   Create a .env file in the `fact-bounty-flask` folder and add the following:

        ```bash
        export FLASK_APP="app.py"
        export SECRET_KEY="some-very-long-string-of-random-characters-CHANGE-TO-YOUR-LIKING"
        export FLASK_ENV="development"
        export FLASK_CONFIG="development"

        export DEV_DATABASE_URL=""
        export TEST_DATABASE_URL=""
        export DATABASE_URL=""

        export ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL=""
        export ELASTIC_SEARCH_USERNAME=""
        export ELASTIC_SEARCH_PASSWORD=""

        export TZ="Asia/Colombo"

        export MAIL_USERNAME=""
        export MAIL_PASSWORD=""
        export FACTBOUNTY_ADMIN=""
        export MAIL_PORT="587"
        export MAIL_USE_TLS="true"
        export MAIL_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
        ```

    Save the file.

-   #### Install your requirements

    ```bash
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-   #### Set up github pre-hook

    ```bash
    (venv)$ pre-commit install
    ```

-   #### Running It

    On your terminal, run the server using this one simple command:

    ```bash
    (venv)$ flask run
    ```

-   #### Add sample data
    Browse to db folder inside `fact-Bounty` and run:

    ```bash

    (venv)$ python add_es.py
    ```

### How to install Elasticsearch and start elasticsearch server

-   #### Elasticsearch v7.6.0 can be installed as follows

    ```bash
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.6.0-amd64.deb
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.6.0-amd64.deb.sha512
    shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-7.6.0-amd64.deb.sha512
    sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-7.6.0-amd64.deb

    ```

    If you're an Arch Linux user, install it using the package manager, pacman

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S elasticsearch
    ```

-   #### Check whether your system uses `init` or `systemd` by running command

    ```bash
    ps -p 1
    ```

-   #### Running Elasticsearch with SysV `init`

    -   Use the update-rc.d command to configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up:

        ```bash
        sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10
        ```

    -   Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the service command:

        ```bash
        sudo -i service elasticsearch start
        sudo -i service elasticsearch stop
        ```


-   #### Running Elasticsearch with SysV `systemd`

    -   To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

        ```bash
        sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
        ```

    -   Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the service command:

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service
        ```

    -   If you're facing issues in starting `elasticsearch.service`, check your system default Java version as Elasticsearch requires at least OpenJDK 10.

-   #### Check Elasticsearch server is running by
    `CURL` request:

    ```bash
    (venv)$ curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"
    ```
    
    or open [localhost:9200](localhost:9200)

### How to Use

-   Use two terminals, one for `fact-bounty-flask` and the other for `fact-bounty-client`.

-   Run the flask server in the `fact-bounty-flask` folder:

    ```bash
    (venv)$ flask run
    ```

-   Start the npm server in fact-bounty-client directory.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

And use [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to browse.

> **NOTE**: This version is only supporting for Chrome browser. And make sure to install the extension -> Redux Dev Tools in chrome extension library.

### Running with Docker

-   #### Set DEV_DATABASE_URL as environment variable in fact-bounty-flask else it will connect to default i.e `data-dev.sqlite`

-   #### In the root of the project directory, run `docker-compose build`

    If you are on Linux machine, execute the following steps to install compose.

    ```bash
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

-   #### Set Environment Variables

    Create a .env file inside fact-bounty-flask and add the following:

    ```bash
    FLASK_APP="app.py"
    SECRET_KEY="some-very-long-string-of-random-characters-CHANGE-TO-YOUR-LIKING"
    FLASK_ENV="development"
    FLASK_CONFIG="development"

    DEV_DATABASE_URL=""
    TEST_DATABASE_URL=""
    DATABASE_URL=""

    ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL=""
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_USERNAME=""
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_PASSWORD=""

    TZ=“Asia/Colombo”
    ```

    Save the file.

-   #### Once build completes, run `docker-compose up`
